# Development

If you're interested in receiving development services from me, **please reach out to me by email (ivan.a.neto@hotmail.com) to discuss pricing and particular needs. You can also reach out to me through the booking page.

## Contractual Development

If you want me to develop something for you - website, game, or any such product - we will make a contract based on your needs and the skill required to create the product. We will promise deliverables within a preset deadline in order to fit your needs.

I typically require plenty of communication (via email, phone call, or text) to ensure that your specifications and needs are completely met and you can gain a real benefit from the product.
