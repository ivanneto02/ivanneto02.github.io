## Other Products

Pricing for miscellaneous products varies depending on:

### Complexity

Projects requiring highly complex server/client interactions will require higher initial investment from the developer, requiring higher price.

For projects requiring expensive infrastructure like databses, we mostly work with AWS. We require that you provide funding for these services through a payment provider.

### Scope

Some projects require knowledge from several subject areas. The pricing for the products depends on the knowledge required, and the different interactions between third-party services.

### Budget

We are very flexible. Your budget highly determines the prices in these miscellaneous projects.


### Timeline

For tighter timelines, we incur a fee due to the cost of not working on other projects. Typically this fee is 15%, though may increase depending on the tightness of the deadline.

### Upkeep Requirements

Some projects require constant upkeep, such as fixing bugs. This upkeep requirement may incur a mandatory upkeep fee. The complexity of upkeep determines the upkeep fee amount.
