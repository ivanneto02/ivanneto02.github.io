## Introduction

Tutoring is a huge part of my academic, professional, and personal life. Ever since High School, I've been tutoring my friends and peers for any subject they may be struggling with.

Currently I attend the University of California, Riverside as a fourth-year major in Computer Science. I have found myself in a perfect place to keep doing tutoring work for friends, family, and peers.

## Educational Background

### Relevant High School Education

In High School, I had the opportunity to partake in AP Calculus AB and AP Calculus BC. These two classes really expanded my knowledge of mathematics at the time. Until that point, I had only had experience with High School level arithmetic, geometry, and trigonometry. But through the help of my amazing teacher Don Tulac, I was able to learn many amazing Calculus concepts that very properly propped me up to be successful in Computer Science.

### Relevant University Education

All throughout my stay at the University of California, Riverside I have enjoyed many courses that have expanded my knowledge of mathematics and Computer Science in radical ways. For some honorable mentions, I really enjoyed the CS150 - Automata Theory - course by Professor Paea LePendu. I thoroughly enjoyed the way Prof. LePendu teaches and the many applications that finite-state automata give us. To expand on this, CS120B was a course that I enjoyed, and it is taught by Professor Phillip Brisk. I created a Youtube channel with all the amazing labs and programs that we were assigned in this course, which teaches us how to use finite-state automata, or "state machines" to create state-based programs in arduino. Here is an example video of my final project for that class.

### Areas of Expertise

#### Data Structures and Algorithms

My journey with Data Structures and Algorithms began with my very first lecture at UCR, which was my CS010A course, or "Introduction to Programming in C/C++". The reason why I say this is my introduction to Data Structures is because C++ became my favorite programming language throughout the years. It is the language that I most enjoy programming with, because of its versatility and low-level access. Although I also enjoy other programming languages such as Python, Javascript, Java, among others, there is a sense of control that is lacking from these that is ever present in C++. Without this language, I never would have continued my love for Data Structures and Algorithms concepts that I learned in subsequent courses.

CS010B and CS010C served to strengthen my understanding of C/C++, as well as many data structures concepts. Mainly, I learned the intricacies of Object-Oriented Programming with exercises such as dynamic typing with pointers and memory allocated on the heap.

#### Machine Learning and Data Science

Most of my work throughout my University career has to do with Machine Learning and Data Science. During Summer 2021, 2022, and 2023, I partook in several summer researchships that taught me the basics of Machine Learning with frameworks such as Tensorflow and Pytorch. Further, data manipulation tools in Python such as Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib were utilized for visualization.

In terms of projects in this area, the resume link at the top contains this information. For the most part, the projects follow a "Data Science Pipeline". This pipeline is standardized among several projects, and it mostly contains (1) preprocessing, (2) visualization, (3) feature engineering, and (4) prediction or regression - depending on the project I'm doing.
