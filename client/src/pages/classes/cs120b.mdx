# CS120B - Introduction to Embedded Systems

2022 was a very exciting year, as I got to take this wonderful course at UCR, focusing on embedded systems and their applications. We utilized the Arduino UNO platform to build several types of circuits, and learned how to manipulate state machines to achieve results. All of the code was written in <a href="https://cplusplus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">C/C++</a>, and having some experience with it definitely helped.
