## Purpose

<a name="why-i-play-this-world"></a>
### The origins of the world

I started this world back in April of 2019, matching the release of Minecraft 1.14 - <a href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Village_%26_Pillage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">The Village and Pillage Update</a>. During this time, I was hoping to make a long term survival world to see just how far I could get in the game. It ended up becoming a multi-year project where I continually try to improve.

### Why I like Singleplayer Minecraft

It is my opinion that singleplayer Minecraft is a tricky exercise of balancing achievement and self-restraint. One can simply hop into Minecraft, beat the Enderdragon, Wither, loot all the structures, all within a 12-hour window - one very liberal estimate. However, doing this would sap all motivation to continue improving the world, even from a well-seasoned Minecraft expert.

It is thus that I chose not to achieve all the goals in the game immediately, but rather opted for a path of self-restraint. This not only allowed for a more timely enjoyment of the game, but also let me keep my motivation to play this world for many years to come. Even now, I have not crafted more than a single beacon, allowing my mini-Minecraft-me to enjoy good old-fashioned walking and running.

Another aspect of singleplayer Minecraft I enjoy, and controversially so, is the lonely aspect of this 30,000,000x30,000,000 block map. One does not meet any other players throughout the entire gameplay, which to me is a charm unmatched in any of the fancy new game releases.

## Projects

### Project 1: Potato Farm

Nowadays, potato farms are not my main priority. But, back in the day it used to be my main priority - the holy grail of emerald collection. In short, farming potatoes at scale like this allows you to trade with farmer villagers to get emeralds. Finally, emeralds let you trade with librarians for enchanted books.

### Project 2: Enderman Farm

For the most part, in newer worlds I do not end up making enderman farms. The reason behind this is that a good gold farm is much, much better at getting xp than an enderman farm. You also get gold at the same time, which makes it a much better choice. But, I lacked awareness of the topic in this save, so I made it!

### Project 4: Iron Farm

The iron farm is a trusty farm I still make in every save. Iron is used in anything from shears, buckets, anvils, to more technical items like hoppers and pistons. All of these items are needed to make bigger and better farms, leading me to make it a priority in my saves.

### Project 5: Drowned Farm

This one was optional. I wanted a trident so I could travel very quickly when it is raining. If you were not aware, when you couple an elytra with a Riptide III trident, you travel much faster during the rain.

I did my best to collect every type of necessary enchanted book, though I am sure I missed some.

### Project 7: Creeper Farm

The creeper farm is among the most useful late-game farms. Having an elytra, the creeper farm fuels the rockets needed to make the elytra fly. At first, it was a big bother hunting down creepers for fuel. It led me to build this farm for efficiency.

### Project 8: Nether Highway

The nether highway is what ties each farm together. Without it, traversing the world would take 8 times the time. Further, by jumping and running in this 2x2 space allows the player to travel much faster. And, the elytra is not needed while traversing the highway, which prevents it from breaking. The nether highway is thus one of the first projects I always make in survival worlds now.

## Stories

<a name="how-i-got-the-villagers"></a>
### How I got the Villagers

Acquiring the villagers was essential to complete most of the farms that I have for this world. For instance, the iron farm requires four villagers for every level. For multi-level farms like the potato farm (requires two villagers per level), dozens of villagers may need to work away for our gain.

<div className="halfgrid">
	<div className="halfgriditem emphasis4 dark card">
		### Villagers
		<img className="articleImage" src="/images/minecraft/villagers/villagers.png" alt="" width="70%"></img>

	<div className="halfgriditem emphasis4 dark card">
		### Breeder
		<img className="articleImage" src="/images/minecraft/villagers/breeder1.png" alt="" width="70%"></img>
	</div>
</div>

The first step was to find a village, apparently presenting no easy task. Without an elytra, I spent multiple hours traversing the world to find the perfect village that was close to my base.

<div className="halfgrid">
	<div className="halfgriditem emphasis4 dark card">
		### Village Far View

		### Village Close View
		<img className="articleImage" src="/images/minecraft/villagers/village2.png" alt="" width="70%"></img>
	</div>
</div>

Finally, I moved the villagers to my base through a nether portal connected to the nether highway. This accentuates the importance of the nether highway in the world.

### Building my House

Typically, I would not build a house in a survival world like this. I am the type of person to keep a hut as a house for the entire duration of my save. However, something called to me this time around. Since it was going to be a long term project, I thought "why not build a home I am proud of for once?"

	Note: The basement was created as an expansion space for storage!

	<img className="articleImage" src="/images/minecraft/house/inner1.png" alt="" width="70%"></img>

### Multiple rooms

I wanted this house to be pretty big. Basically, I wanted a place that I could expand into and make my main base. I did not want to build multiple bases to expand storage into, make more space for little additions, etc. Thus, I wanted multiple rooms
